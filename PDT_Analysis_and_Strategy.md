2. **Week 2:** Focus on QBTS and JNJ (2 trades max)  
3. **Week 3:** Focus on RGTI and best performer (2 trades max)
4. **Flexible trade:** Save 1 trade for unexpected opportunities

**Key Decision Point:** Choose between:
1. **Swing Trading Adaptation** (recommended) - modify current system
2. **Cash Account Switch** - unlimited day trades but T+2 settlement
3. **Build to $25K** - maintain current intraday focus

The quantum-focused watchlist provides good diversification between high-volatility plays (quantum stocks) and stable overnight holds (PG, JNJ), making it well-suited for PDT-compliant swing trading.
