# 🔧 LAUNCHER FIXES APPLIED

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 📂 Script Path Updates
**Problem**: After workspace reorganization, launcher was looking for scripts in wrong locations.

**Fixed**:
- `backup_system.py` → `scripts/backup_system.py`
- `eod_analysis.py` → `scripts/eod_analysis.py`

### 🛠️ Backup System Enhancement
**Problem**: Missing `schedule` module caused backup system to crash.

**Fixed**:
- Added conditional import for `schedule` module
- Graceful degradation when module not available
- Clear instructions for installing missing dependency

## 🧪 Test Results

### ✅ Manual Backup Test
```bash
python scripts/backup_system.py backup
```
**Result**: ✅ Success
- Backup completed successfully
- All reorganized files committed to GitHub
- Repository: https://github.com/fortis2a/rev_intraday_bot.git

### ✅ Launcher Functionality
- All menu options accessible
- Script paths updated correctly
- No broken references
