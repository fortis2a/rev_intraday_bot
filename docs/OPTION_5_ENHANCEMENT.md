# Option 5 Enhancement: Market Timer Integration

## Issue Fixed
Option 5 ("Start Live Trading + Show Signal Feed") previously did not show timer or market close message when the market was closed.

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ Enhanced Market Status Detection
- Added comprehensive market status checking at the start of option 5
- Improved python command path resolution to use virtual environment
- Fixed string parsing to correctly identify OPEN/CLOSED status

### ✅ Market Closed Warning System
When market is closed, option 5 now displays:
```
[NOTICE] ⚠️  MARKET IS CURRENTLY CLOSED ⚠️
[INFO] Trading signals will be limited during market hours

[COUNTDOWN] Next Market Open: 2025-08-14 09:30:00 EDT
[COUNTDOWN] Time Until Open: 13:09:01

[OPTIONS]
1. Continue anyway (demo/testing mode)
2. Start live timer and wait for market open
3. Return to main menu
```

### ✅ Interactive Options Menu
Users can now choose:
1. **Continue anyway** - Proceed with demo/testing mode
2. **Start live timer** - Launch the live countdown timer
3. **Return to main menu** - Go back to main launcher

### ✅ Timer Integration
- Option 2 launches the same live timer as option 14
- Real-time countdown updates every second
- Proper timezone handling (US/Eastern)
- Clean exit back to main menu with Ctrl+C

## Technical Changes Made

### Code Modifications
1. **launcher.py line ~20**: Fixed python command path resolution
2. **launcher.py lines ~590-650**: Enhanced `start_live_trading_with_signals()` method
3. Added market status detection with proper string parsing
4. Integrated countdown display functionality
5. Added interactive options menu

### Dependencies
- Uses existing `pytz` for timezone handling
- Leverages `data_manager.py` for market status
- Integrates with existing timer functionality

## Testing Results

### ✅ Market Status Detection
```bash
python test_market_status.py
# ✅ Market is CLOSED - warning should be shown
```

### ✅ Option 5 Logic
```bash
python test_option_5.py
# Shows full countdown and options menu
```

### ✅ Live Demo
```bash
python demo_option_5.py
# Demonstrates complete enhanced functionality
```
