🎯 SPECIFIC STOCK ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔬 QBTS (Most Profitable - $0.02):
WHY IT WORKED:
• Minimal price movement exploitation
• Better timing on entries/exits
• Smaller position sizes reduced risk
• 66-minute average hold time optimal

RECOMMENDATION: ✅ CONTINUE with enhanced position sizing

🔬 RGTI (Worst Performer - -$2.26):
WHY IT FAILED:
• Negative price spread (-$0.01 average)
• Extremely short hold times (1.8 min average)
• All 5 trades were losers
• Rapid-fire trading without proper signals

RECOMMENDATION: ❌ AVOID or revise strategy completely

🔬 IONQ (Mixed Results - -$5.56):
WHY MIXED:
• Long positions: 75% win rate but small gains
• Short positions: 0% win rate with large losses
• Volatile stock requiring longer hold times
• Good for longs, terrible for shorts

RECOMMENDATION: ⚠️ LONGS ONLY, avoid shorting
