# 🎯 TRAILING STOP SYSTEM - PROFIT & STOP LOSS THRESHOLDS

## 📊 SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

### Core Parameters
- **Trailing Stop Enabled**: `True`
- **Trailing Distance**: `2.0%` - Distance below highest price for stop
- **Activation Threshold**: `1.5%` - Profit level to activate trailing
- **Minimum Move**: `0.5%` - Minimum price move to adjust stop
- **Initial Stop Loss**: `2.0%` - Fixed stop before trailing activates
- **Take Profit**: `4.0%` - Fixed profit target (optional)

## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS

### Phase 1: Initial Protection (0% to 1.5% profit)
- **Fixed Stop Loss**: Entry price - 2.0%
- **Example**: Entry at $100.00 → Stop at $98.00
- **Protection**: Limits loss to -$2.00 per share

### Phase 2: Trailing Activation (1.5%+ profit)
- **Trigger**: When profit reaches +1.5%
- **Initial Trailing Stop**: Highest price - 2.0%
- **Example**: Price reaches $101.50 → Trailing stop at $99.47
- **Protection**: Locks in -0.5% loss (better than -2.0% fixed)

### Phase 3: Profit Protection (Ongoing)
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Stop follows price up, never down
- **Example Progression**:
  - Price $103.00 → Stop $100.94 (0.9% profit protected)
  - Price $105.00 → Stop $102.90 (2.9% profit protected)
  - Price $108.00 → Stop $105.84 (5.8% profit protected)

## 💰 PROFIT & LOSS THRESHOLDS

### Maximum Loss Scenarios
| Scenario | Maximum Loss | Condition |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Before activation | -2.0% | Price drops before reaching +1.5% |
| After activation | -0.5% to +∞% | Depends on highest price reached |

### Profit Protection Examples

#### Example 1: $100 Entry, Peak $110
- **Highest Price**: $110.00
- **Trailing Stop**: $107.80 (2% below peak)
- **Protected Profit**: 7.8% if stopped out
- **Risk**: Price can drop 2.0% from peak before triggering

#### Example 2: $100 Entry, Peak $120
- **Highest Price**: $120.00
- **Trailing Stop**: $117.60 (2% below peak)
- **Protected Profit**: 17.6% if stopped out
- **Risk**: Price can drop 2.4% from peak before triggering

## 🎯 KEY ADVANTAGES

## ⚙️ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Activation Logic
```python
# Trailing activates when:
current_profit_pct >= TRAILING_STOP_ACTIVATION (1.5%)

# Stop adjusts when:
new_stop = highest_price * (1 - TRAILING_STOP_PCT)
if new_stop > current_stop + TRAILING_STOP_MIN_MOVE:
    update_stop(new_stop)
```

### Stop Trigger Logic
```python
# Position closed when:
current_price <= trailing_stop_price
```

## 📈 REAL TRADING IMPACT

### Position Size: 100 shares at $50/share ($5,000 position)

| $55.00 | $53.90 | $390 | $110 |
| $60.00 | $58.80 | $880 | $120 |
| $70.00 | $68.60 | $1,860 | $140 |
