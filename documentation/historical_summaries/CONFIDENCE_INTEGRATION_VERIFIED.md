# üéØ INDIVIDUALIZED CONFIDENCE INTEGRATION VERIFICATION

## ‚úÖ **VERIFICATION COMPLETE - August 14, 2025**

Your trading bot is now **FULLY INTEGRATED** with individualized confidence signals that are calculated in real-time before every trade decision.

---

## üîß **What Was Integrated:**

### **1. Real-Time Confidence Check (CRITICAL)**
- **Location**: `core/intraday_engine.py` ‚Üí `execute_signal()` method
- **Function**: Every trade now calls `should_execute_trade()` before execution
- **Threshold**: 75% minimum confidence required for all trades
- **Fallback**: NO FALLBACK - if confidence calculation fails, trade is rejected

### **2. Stock-Specific Risk Thresholds**
- **Location**: `core/intraday_engine.py` ‚Üí stop-loss and profit target calculations
- **Function**: Uses `get_stock_thresholds()` instead of generic config values
- **Example**: SOXL uses 0.48% stop vs TQQQ uses 0.30% stop
- **Fallback**: Generic config values if stock-specific lookup fails

### **3. Individual Technical Analysis**
- **Real-time calculation** of 8 technical indicators per stock
- **MACD, EMA, RSI, Volume, VWAP, Bollinger** bands analysis
- **Market condition adaptation** throughout trading day
- **Component scoring** with detailed logging
