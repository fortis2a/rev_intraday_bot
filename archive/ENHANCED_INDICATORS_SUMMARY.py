    """
    Example of how enhanced signals work:
    
    BULLISH MOMENTUM SIGNAL REQUIRES 5/8:
    1. Price change > threshold (✓)
    2. Volume > 1.5x average (✓)
    3. RSI < 70 (not overbought) (✓)
    4. Price > EMA 9 (✓)
    5. EMA 9 > EMA 21 (trend) (✓)
    6. MACD > Signal (✓)
    7. Price > VWAP (✓)
    8. Fresh crossover (EMA/MACD) (✗)
    
    Result: 7/8 confirmations = STRONG BUY SIGNAL
    Confidence: 87.5% * price_change_magnitude
